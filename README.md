# zoopla-bathrooms
Filter Zoopla property results by number the number of bathrooms a property proclaims to have.

## Status
Currently on hold, until I need another house. So, likely going to be fully featured around September time!

## What is this?
A small web application that lets you input the minimum number of bathrooms you wish a property to have, plus any  regular Zoopla search inputs.

This feature is currently absent from the main Zoopla site, the application is my way of solving my own problem.

No one wants to endure a battle royale bathroom ritual every morning.

## Thanks to...
Zoopla! For letting me use their pretty darn good API for free.
