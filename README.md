# zoopla-bathrooms
Filter Zoopla property results by number the number of bathrooms a property proclaims to have.

## What is this?
A small web application that lets you input the minimum number of bathrooms you wish a property to have, plus any  regular Zoopla search inputs.

This feature is currently absent from the main Zoopla site, the application is my way of solving my own problem.

No one wants to endure a daily battle royale ritual for the bathroom in the morning.

## Thanks to...
Zoopla! For letting me use their pretty darn good API for free.
